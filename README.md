# fac3_logging

logging centralization:

for logging - https://github.com/roidrage/lograge
papertrail via remote syslog - https://github.com/papertrail/remote_syslog2

we should standardize the config by building a gem which we can just include everywhere

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fac3_logging'
